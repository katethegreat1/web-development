# Week 1, Tuesday afternoon

## Concept Discussion

* Managing package dependencies with npm
* Package dependencies and source control
* Using external packages
* Writing and running npm scripts


## Demo

`cowsay` FTW! :wink:

* `npm init` (optionally with `-y` to skip the prompts)
* `echo node_modules >> .gitignore` so we don't commit our dependencies
* `npm install cowsay` (or `npm i cowsay`)
* Write code in `index.js` and MOOO!
* `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` cool, eh?
